# Pandya_Wotton_AJAX_Redux

## Description
For this project we used the Star Wars API (SWAPI) in order to create a page that allows you to view different information on characters in the Star Wars universe. Each character has a mini description, as well as info on what movies they appear in. The API is accesed via AJAX and JSON.
